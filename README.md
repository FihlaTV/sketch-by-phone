## Installation

```sh
make install
```

## Development

You'll need a sheet of paper with the [hero image](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/data/images/HIRO.jpg) printed in the top left corner.
You'll also need an external webcam connected to your computer.

```sh
make start
```

This will open the app in your browser. Allow it to use your webcam then point the camera to the hiro sign you printed.
